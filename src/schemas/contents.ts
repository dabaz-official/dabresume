    description: 'DabChat is a web-based chat platform built with Next.js and TypeScript. For the front-end, I made full use of Next.js and strictly utilized TypeScript to ensure type safety and enhance code quality. On the back-end, I chose MySQL as our relational database and seamlessly integrated it using Prisma, a modern database toolkit. A key feature of DabChat is its implementation of end-to-end encryption, ensuring the highest level of privacy and security for user communications.',
